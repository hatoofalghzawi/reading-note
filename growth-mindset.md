Having a growth mindset is important because it can help you overcome obstacles you may face when learning something new or developing a new skill. 


 Growth mindsets understand the importance of persistence and determination. By changing the way you think, you can change the way you learn.



 ### ***difintion***: A growth mindset, proposed by Stanford professor Carol Dweck in her book Mindset, describes people who believe that their success depends on time and effort. People with a growth mindset feel their skills and intelligence can be improved with effort and persistence. They embrace challenges, persist through obstacles, learn from criticism and seek out inspiration in othersâ€™ success.

### ***From my point of view*** I see that the developing mentality is not about time and effort, but rather in creating the fastest and most effective way to reach our desired goal with the lowest fees, so my production depends on:




   
   1. ***Defining a new goal after each investigation to accomplish the past*** 

2. ***Search for a methodology that will reach me in the most short and least costly way***

3. ***Start implementing and in the event that I encounter obstacles in it, I devise a  new  method, so I always set a plan B***
