I think I found what might suit me in text editing, as I always prefer comprehensive matters as well as in editors, so I chose IDE because it is simply a comprehensive, integrated group that facilitates our work with many benefits

    1.  saves time and effort.
    2.  Software development requires extensive knowledge of grammar
    3.  symbols formats and good knowledge of the language  Therefore
    
    
    
IDE is a very suitable option it is suitable for a developer who has a good background in programming so I will use it in the future.


    
 but  today I think  I need to use **brackets** as it provides everything for **beginners**. 
    
It includes all the features available in others and works on all types of devices.






As for the programming world, the options are very wide and the programs are numerous in line with the various directives of the developers, so we find programs that come with the devices themselves, but they are not very feasible as they will not modify your errors, translate or even complete your codes, and as for the development programs, there are many of them with programming basics and free or paid additions  Symbolically, including and what is comprehensive and free, purely and some of them are limited in two or three languages. You have the freedom to **choose what you like and love**.
